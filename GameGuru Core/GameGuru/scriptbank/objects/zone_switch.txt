Zone Switch Behavior


The Zone switch behaviour allows for a switch to make a zone become active.
It is made up of the zoneswitch behavior, and other switched_winzone or 
switched_plrinzone behaviors

Place a trigger zone on the map and attached either the switched_winzone
or switched_plrinzone behavior. Name the Zone (eg: My Win Zone).

Place an object to be used for the switch and attach the zoneswitch beavior
to the object. In the Zone Name field place the name you gave the Zone
(eg: My Win Zone) to be switch activated.

Now the selected zone wont do anything until the switch is activated first.

Behavior Options:
Enter the PROMPT TEXT
Enter the USAGE RANGE
Enter the ACTIVATED TEXT for after switch activation
Enter the ZONE NAME of the zone being used.
<Sound0> for the switch sound
<Sound1> for after activation.

This switch can also be logic attached to activate other object/zones
