Imagepanel Behavior

The Imagepanel behaviour allows for an image for possibly a panel or
even bigger for full screen effects to be displayd with 8 overlays
that can be timed for showing. This can be activated with a trigger zone
a switch or a ranged object used as a useable switch.

Images are stored in the "imagebank\user\imagepanel\subdirectories of your naming"
an example one is in "imagebank\user\imagepanel\set1"
The files in these subdirectories must be named as follows.
panel.png
overlay1.png
overlay2.png
overlay3.png
overlay4.png
overlay5.png
overlay6.png
overlay7.png
overlay8.png

Other Behaviour settings include:
Set the use range if any set to 0 if using a trigger zone or switch
Set the prompt text if required
Set the position X for the panel
Set the position Y for the panel
Set the scale of the panel
Set the Aspect Ratio
Set how many overlays to show
Set the time between showing overlays
Set the delay time after all panel/overlays are shown
Set the subdirectory name only of your image sets to match the subdirectory you have made. The default is 'set1'
Set wether the image panel is reviewable, only for switches and ranged object switches only.
